If you've added a new file to your project and want to push it to your GitHub repository along with your existing changes, you can follow these steps:

Check Status: First, check the status of your Git repository to see which files are new or modified:
lua
Copy code
git status
This command will show you the status of your working directory and staging area.
Add New File: If your new file is listed as an untracked file, you need to add it to the staging area using the following command:
csharp
Copy code
git add filename
Replace filename with the name of your new file.
Commit Changes: Once you've added the new file to the staging area, commit your changes with a descriptive commit message:
sql
Copy code
git commit -m "Add new file filename"
Replace filename with the name of your new file, and provide a meaningful commit message.
Push Changes to GitHub: Finally, push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub:
perl
Copy code
git push origin master
Replace master with the name of your branch if you're working on a different branch.
